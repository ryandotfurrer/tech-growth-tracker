# Tech Growth Tracker

After attending [THAT Conference](https://that.us), I became inspired to do even more to get into the tech industry. As such, I have so many things I want to do and work on that it is easy to get lost.

I am creating this to act as a sort of guide, rubric, and tracker to ensure I am doing those things to help push me forward.
